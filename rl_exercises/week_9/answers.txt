Level 1

    - 1.1 Sample Efficiency:
        1. Dyna-PPO reaches 1000 steps sooner 80 % of the final PPO return (with a return of 221.72 at 13,000 steps compared to a return of 220.6 at 14,000 steps for PPO)
        2. there seems to be a “model learning penalty”, since Dyna-PPO's performance is (generally) lower than that of PPO during the first ~10,000 steps

    - 1.2 Model Prediction Accuracy:
        1. 
        2.
